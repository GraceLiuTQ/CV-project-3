# Hough Transform

In this assignment, we will perform a Hough Transform for line detection. In particular, you will add code to p3.py to do the following:

## Todos
1. Read an Image and convert it into a floating point numpy array with values scaled to be between 0 and 1
2. Create a gaussian filter of size k x k and with standard deviation sigma
  - Produces a k x k gaussian filter with standard deviation sigma
  - Make sure the gaussian filter is normalized (filter should sum to one)
  - Assume k is odd
3. Compute the image gradient
  - Convert the image to grayscale by using the formula:
    - Intensity = Y = 0.2125 R + 0.7154 G + 0.0721 B
  - Convolve with a 5x5 Gaussian with a standard deviation of 1 to smooth out noise
    - Perform “same” convolution, i.e., output image should be the same size as the input
    - Use scipy.signal.convolve for this task
  - Convolve with [0.5, 0, -0.5] to get the X derivative on each channel and convolve with [[0.5],[0],[-0.5]] to get the Y derivative
    - Again, perform “same” convolution
    - Use scipy.signal.convolve
  - Return the gradient magnitude (remember to use np.sqrt to get the square root) and the gradient orientation (use np.arctan2)
4. Compute the distance between pixels (x, y) and a line with equation `𝑥𝑐𝑜𝑠(θ) + 𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑛(θ) + 𝑐 = 0`.ReturnabooleanarraythatisTrueforpixelswhose distance is less than a given threshold
  - Compute the distance using the formula:
    - `d=|𝑥𝑐𝑜𝑠(θ) + 𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑛(θ) + 𝑐 = 0|`
5. Draw lines on the image
  - Make a copy of the image
  - Set pixels that are within threshold distance from a set of given lines to have RGB value (1,0,0)
6. Hough voting
  - You get as input gradient magnitude and the gradient orientation arrays, as well as a set of possible theta values and a set of possible c values. If there are T entries in thetas and C entries in cs, the output should be a T x C array. Each pixel in the image should vote for (theta, c) if:
    - Its gradient magnitude is greater than thresh1
    - Its distance from the (theta, c) line is less than thresh2, and
    - The difference between theta and the pixel's gradient orientation is less than thresh3
  - You may want to filter by indices that meet condition (i) first to reduce the number of computations necessary
7. Find local maxima in the array of votes. A (theta, c) pair counts as a local maxima if 1. Its votes are greater than thresh, and
  - Its value is the maximum in a nbhd x nbhd neighborhood in the votes array.
  - Return a list of (theta, c) pairs

Once you are done, running p3-demo.ipynb should produce the output shown in p3-demo.html

## Installation instructions
For this assignment, you will need to install a number of tools including Anaconda, python3, and Jupyter. Alternatively, you can also install python3, VSCode, and the Jupyter extension for VSCode.

### OPTION 1: Anaconda installation
Anaconda will come with an installation of Python and many important packages that we will use in this class.
You may install Anaconda at the following links:
- macOS 
- Windows 
- Linux
Be sure to install a version of Anaconda that supports python3.

#### Jupyter installation
Now that you have conda, installation of Jupyter is fairly simple.
You will need Jupyter notebook, which you can install using `conda install -c conda-forge notebook`.
After installing, you can navigate to the directory in which the notebook is contained, and run the command `jupyter notebook`.

### OPTION 2: VSCode Setup
Install Python, VSCode, and install the Python and Jupyter extensions in VSCode.

Next, create a virtual environment to install the necessary Python packages using `python3 -m venv p3-venv`, and activate it by typing source `p3-venv/bin/activate` (for Mac/Linux) or
(for Windows) in the terminal `p3-venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

Install matplotlib, numpy, and Pillow by running `pip install matplotlib`. This will also install numpy and Pillow as dependencies.

## Rules of the game
Only modify functions with a TODO above it. Submit p3.py. No additional imports are allowed.

## Potentially Useful Functions
You are not required to use these functions, but you may find them helpful.

Basic numpy functions (sum, zeros, array, arange, etc)
`numpy.unravel_index()`
- np.unravel_index [indices] [shape] creates an array of shape [shape], with elements numbered in increasing order, and returns the coordinates of the index where the index value matches an element of [indices]
- E.g. np.unravel_index([2,4], (2,3)) → y index: array([0, 1], dtype=int64), x index: array([2, 1], dtype=int64)
○ [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], where the indices of 2 and 4 are (0, 2) and (1, 1) 
`numpy.where()`
- Produces the indices of a numpy array where a condition holds
zip()
- If you use zip() with n arguments, then the function will return an iterator that generates tuples of length n
  - `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
  - `zipped = zip(numbers, letters)`
  - `list(zipped)`
  - => `[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]`
